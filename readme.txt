List posts (listicles) get traction, but are tough to author with pizzazz. Make fun, social lists to rank, embed & share

== Description ==

**Integrate Numbered Lists/Listicles on Wordpress & Beyond**

Listly lets your audience actively contribute to your posts, while giving you the power to moderate. In reality, no list is ever complete. With Listly, the audience help your content evolve via social engagement. Communities form around shared interests, needs & expertise.

Use Listy to create, curate or collaborate to build awesome, people-ranked numbered-lists. One plugin, many uses. A tool you can put to work in many ways.

What kind of Listlys will you make? 

**Get more from your numbered list posts with Listly**

List posts work, we just believe a social list platform beats personal lists (i.e. lists as text in blog posts). You wouldn't self-host a video today. We believe this applies to collaborative lists. 

Media platforms that are social, like YouTube, Slideshare & Instagram prove content outperforms if it's findable, shareable & embeddabe. They ensure your content gets found independent of you (they are all destination sites - people go there to find content). If you ignore these platform your blog is operating in a vaccuum

Making lists together is more fun & more productive. Begin lists with just a few items; an imperfect list, then ask for help to enhance the list. It's a never ending task, that your community can embrace & drive. Working alone on lists is just 1.0

Your job is to source & seed list ideas. Ask questions in the form of lists. Why is talk radio engaging? Because the audience plays an active role by answering questions. Listly's paradigm emulates talk radio.

**Your listicles should be inviting & enaging** 

Start lists & share them to entice readers to contribute & participate. Don't try to be exhaustive & perfect. Leave gaps. Don't be a smarticle. Sharing all you know is neither social nor inviting. An exhaustive list is unapproachable. Leave room for "Joe Public" to help. Be imperfecticle. If you ask for help, look like you need it and pitch it at a level where people see they can add to the conversation. Be real.

Imperfection is sexy. Your imperfections are sexy. The only person that does not know this is you. 

- [Bren√© Brown knows it](http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en). 
- [Yo Yo Ma does too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mev2jwvJ-k&feature=youtu.be). 

By sharing your imperfections, you generously let others shine. Perhaps that's not something you expected to read on a Wordpress plugin page, but [genrosity is a strategy](http://blog.list.ly/2013/08/20/generosity-as-a-strategy/). 

Collaborative, embeddable, shareable lists will always outperform static HTML lists. You'll enjoy more views & engagement because people can embed & extend your ideas. You own what more means. Get out what you put in. 

- A great static list will get stolen/copied/ignored/forgotten/outdated
- A great Listly list will get embedded, shared & maintained

Listly ensures your lists get more valuable with time as they evolve, attracting more helpers & better SEO ranking. This is the cycle of life when you let your content evolve by empowering people can help. HTML lists lost inside blog post don't behave like this. 

**Benefits of Authoring / Moderating / Administering List Posts with/via Listly:**

1. Add/edit lists directly via blog posts/pages or Listly (inc assisted finding or uploading of custom images) 
2. Let your list posts evolve over time by accepting contributions from your readers (great for SEO)
3. Moderate reader's suggestions as desired ( delete / approve / remove)
4. Readers vote to rank their fave items, so your list post gets more useful over time
5. Effortlessly share lists or list items on Listly or via embeds on any post/page

Authoring lists is tedious. Editing old posts to add omissions/suggestions is worse. Listly lets you (& your audience) update the list content, without editing in WP admin, so nothing breaks. What's the cost of not updating? Does it say you aren't listening? Worse still the utility of your content decays over time. We call it list rot.

**Benefits of leveraging Listly as a publishing or media platform for list posts:**

1. Embed lists & create high traffic list posts on Wordpress & other blogging platforms
2. Listly lists are "responsive" so your content looks great on mobile, tablets & desktops (it's not an iframe - width & height are dynamic, based on available space & device constraints - embed in a page, post or a sidebar)
3. Custom shortcodes allow you to choose from multiple layouts & control list behaviour 
4. Metrics. Track where people view & engage with your lists. See who contributes & build an army of helpers
5. Optionally lists can be hand curated into a custom curated order

**Benefits of leveraging Listly lists for Content Marketing / Content Management:**

1. Earn great organic search traffic. Lists are automatically tagged for SEO best practices. Our biggest list has seen [1.4 million views](http://list.ly/list/Um-old-hindi-evergreen-songs?feature=wpplugin) & that's 100% organic search traffic
2. Include media links on your lists to create interactive platlists eg slides, videos, audio, images, tweets etc (one plugin to let you embed many forms of media)
3. Run contests/surveys to source & rank ideas. Option to let people & ideas on the fly
4. Affiliate product lists have never been easier to create, share & embed (needs Pro)
5. [Get more from your Twitter lists by turning them into social content](http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/06/list-ly-makes-twitter-lists-significantly-more-awesome-social-shareable-manageable-and-rankable/). People lists are a great tool for building engagement eg [Top 10 Women in Business Intelligence](http://www.antivia.com/blog/?p=2435) - 50% of the views came from the blog / 50% from Listly.

30% of the web is numbered list posts. Lists work. Numbered list posts are the best performing content on the web. Listly just makes those posts social & collaborative. Listly elevates lists to be a platform on a par with slides / video media platforms like Slideshare & YouTube.

**Watch to learn the value of embedding Listly lists on your blog:**

When you begin using Listly you can get significant personal utility by saving time on authoring great, visually-appealing lists. Most of all Listly makes lists social & collaborative, but you can grow into that over time.

Listly make your lists reusable: shareable, embeddable as responsive content. HTML lists on blogs add friction to sharing & reuse.

Listly empowers your audience to contribute to the list content on your blog. That's a level of engagement above commenting. People can also embed other people's lists on their blog. 

- Your lists are a source of content for others (just like Slides on Slideshare).
- You can embed other people's lists on your blog (great blog posts in less time).

Use Listly to create useful resource lists (eg Top 10 Wordpress plugins) or Listicle type list (eg 10 Tricks Every Wordpress Developer Wish They Knew). Listly is also great for creating playlists of videos, slides, audio & images. 

Explore the [Getting Started](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/get-started-with-listly-a-beginners-guide-to-social-list-making) guide if you are new to Listly.

Lists & Listly are part of the shift from self-hosted media to embedded media. The social sharing benefits far out weigh control issues. They also enable your content to become [earned media](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/scope-is-the-new-poem-making-sense-of-emerging-digital-media-v3-39720335).

Think of Listly as Slideshare for lists. Put your lists on Listly, then embed them on your blog. Listly is a responsive authoring platform for lists that can be seamlessly embedded in blog posts across the web. 

**Here's 5 simple ideas to begin using Listly on your Wordpress blog:**

1. Track your [guest posts](http://list.ly/list/DNy-guest-blog-posts-2014?search) on other blogs for easy resharing
2. Create people lists of [your team](http://list.ly/list/Bt2-sp24-speakers-and-team?feature=wpplugin) for a given blog or project.
3. Create universal [playlists](http://list.ly/list/1Jt-sampler-official-listly-whitelisted-media-playlist?feature=wpplugin) of relevant slides, videos & podcasts to embed on your blog
4. Create lists of [related posts or resources](http://list.ly/list/8KM-content-marketing-tools/?feature=wpplugin) to help your readers 
5. Manage your [blog roll via Listly](http://polleydan.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/listly-blogroll/) so anyone can  / vote, re-use & extend your list.

We think of Lists as a type of data, just like you think of Slides, Videos or Podcasts. All these technologies have evolved in similar ways to be highly embeddable. They have also become highly trafficed search destination sites. See graphic on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/embeddable-media-categories-shareable-content-v3)

= Can Anyone Add to my lists? =

Yes, but there's a moderation queue, so you can choose to accept of reject suggestions. You can also choose to make the moderation queue invisible.

= Can I make private lists? =

Yes, it's a [premium feature](http://list.ly/upgrade).

= Are the lists responsive? =

Yes, & you can choose from any of the four layouts & all layouts adjust responsively. Lists are not like iFrames. They have dyamic height & width based on the content & the available space.

= How long can a list be? =

There's no limit. We have many lists with 1000+ items. Longer lists are automatically paginated. You can control pagination size. You can search within the list (searches are served based).

= How many people can contribute to a single list? =

There's no limit. We've seen lists with 5k+ contributors. It's all a function of your brand & community size.

= Can I search a list? =

Yes, you can search, filter & paginate within the matching items.

= Can I tell where my list is embedded? =

Yes, Listly tracks how many views each list sees on each domain where it's embedded (& where people voted).

Click on the total view count & that will open a lightbox & display all the view metrics broken down by domain.

You can click on URL in that list & take you to the blog post URL.

Yes, its a pro feature.

You can click on the person's avatar & follow them to their profile.

= Do I have to use the plugin? = 

No, there's a javascript option. We'd recommend the plugin for performance reasons & for SEO reasons. The plugin caches lists locally, offering a second level of caching beyond the caching offered on Listly. Also the Listly list does not appear to the search engines as a widget, but as text so your list content is fully indexed.

= Are changes reflected on my embeded blog post? = 

Yes, the list is first loaded from cache (on your Wordpress install or on Listly). Once the list is loaded it calls to Listly to check for changes & then those changes are shown on your blog.
