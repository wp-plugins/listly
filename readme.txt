List posts (listicles) generate traffic, but it's tedious to author visually-appealing lists. Easy to create, rank, curate & embed  lists.

== Description ==

Integrate numbered lists on Wordpress & beyond. Beyond commenting, Listly lets your audience actively contribute to your blog posts, while you retain control. Get more from your numbered list posts with Listly.

Benefits of Authoring / Moderating / Administering List Posts with/via Listly:

1. Add/edit lists directly via blog posts/pages or Listly (inc assisted finding or uploading of custom images) 
2. Let your list posts evolve over time by accepting contributions from your readers (great for SEO)
3. Moderate reader's suggestions as desired ( delete / approve / remove)
4. Readers vote to rank their fave items, so your list post gets more useful over time
5. Effortlessly share lists or list items on Listly or via embeds on any post/page

Authoring lists is tedious. Editing old posts to add omission/suggestions or to correct is even worse. Listly lets you update the content, without editing the post in WP admin, so nothing breaks. What's the cost of not updating? Does it say you aren listening? Worse still the utility of your content decays over time. We call it list rot.

Benefits of leveraging Listly as a publishing or media platform for list posts:

1. Embed lists & create high traffic list posts on Wordpress & other blogging platforms
3. Listly lists are responsive so your content looks great on mobile, tablets & desktops (it's not an iframe - width & height are dynamic based on available space & device constraints - embed in a page, post or a sidebar)
4. Custom shortcodes allow you to choose from multiple layouts & control list behaviour 
4. Metrics. Track where people view & engage with your lists. See who contributes & build an army of helpers
5. Optionally lists can be hand curated into a custom curated order

Benefits of leveraging Listly lists for Content Marketing / Content Management:

1. Earn great organic search traffic. Lists are automatically tagged for SEO best practices. Our biggest list has seen [1.4 million views](http://list.ly/list/Um-old-hindi-evergreen-songs?feature=wpplugin) & that's 100% organic search traffic
2. Include media links on your lists to create interactive platlists eg slides, videos, audio, images, tweets etc (one plugin to let you embed many forms of media)
3. Run contests/surveys to source & rank ideas. Option to let people & ideas on the fly
4. Affiliate product lists have never been easier to create, share & embed (needs Pro)
5. [Get more from your Twitter lists by turning them into social content](http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/06/list-ly-makes-twitter-lists-significantly-more-awesome-social-shareable-manageable-and-rankable/). People lists are a great tool for building engagement eg [Top 10 Women in Business Intelligence](http://www.antivia.com/blog/?p=2435) - 50% of the views came from the blog / 50% from Listly.

30% of blog posts on the web are in the form of numbered lists. Numbered list posts are the best performing content on the web. Listly just makes those posts social & collaborative. Listly turns lists in a form of media on a par with slides & video.

Watch this video to learn the value of embedding Listly lists on your Wordpress blog:

When you begin using Listly you can get significant personal utility by saving time on authoring great, visually-appealing lists. Most of all Listly makes lists social & collaborative, but you can grow into that over time.

Listly make your lists reusable: shareable, embeddable as responsive content. HTML lists on blogs add friction to sharing and reuse.

Listly empowers your audience to contribute to the list content on your blog. That's a level of engagement above commenting. People can also embed other people's lists on their blog. 

- Your lists are a source of content for others (just like Slides on Slideshare).
- You can embed other people's lists on your blog (great blog posts in less time).

Use Listly to create useful resource lists (eg Top 10 Wordpress plugins) or Listicle type list (eg 10 Tricks Every Wordpress Developer Wish They Knew). Listly is also great for creating playlists of videos, slides, audio & images. 

Explore the [Getting Started](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/get-started-with-listly-a-beginners-guide-to-social-list-making) guide if you are new to Listly.

Lists & Listly are part of the shift from self-hosted media to embedded media. The social sharing benefits far out weigh control issues. They also enable your content to become [earned media](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/scope-is-the-new-poem-making-sense-of-emerging-digital-media-v3-39720335). You wouldn't self host a video today. We believe the same logic applies to collaborative lists that evolve over time.

Think of Listly as Slideshare for lists. Put your lists on Listly, then embed them on your blog. Listly is an responsive authoring platform for lists that can be seamlessly embedded in blog posts across the web. 

Here's 5 simple ideas to begin using Listly on your Wordpress blog:

1. Track your [guest posts](http://list.ly/list/DNy-guest-blog-posts-2014?search) on other blogs for easy resharing
2. Create people lists of [your team](http://list.ly/list/Bt2-sp24-speakers-and-team?feature=wpplugin) for a given blog or project.
3. Create universal [playlists](http://list.ly/list/1Jt-sampler-official-listly-whitelisted-media-playlist?feature=wpplugin) of relevant slides, videos & podcasts to embed on your blog
4. Create lists of [related posts or resources](http://list.ly/list/8KM-content-marketing-tools/?feature=wpplugin) to help your readers 
5. Manage your [blog roll via Listly](http://polleydan.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/listly-blogroll/) so anyone can  / vote, re-use & extend your list.

We think of Lists as a type of data, just like you think of Slides, Videos or Podcasts. All these technologies have evolved in similar ways to be highly embeddable. They have also become highly trafficed search destination sites. See graphic on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/embeddable-media-categories-shareable-content-v3)

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QrsIGbRJrI]

= Can Anyone Add to my lists? =

Yes, but there's a moderation queue, so you can choose to accept of reject suggestions. You can also choose to make the moderation queue invisible.

= Can I make private lists? =

Yes, it's a [premium feature](http://list.ly/upgrade).

= Are the lists responsive? =

Yes, & you can choose from any of the four layouts & all layouts adjust responsively. Lists are not like iFrames. They have dyamic height & width based on the content & the available space.

= How long can a list be? =

There's no limit. We have many lists with 1000+ items. Longer lists are automatically paginated. You can control pagination size. You can search within the list (searches are served based).

= How many people can contribute to a single list? =

There's no limit. We've seen lists with 5k+ contributors. It's all a function of your brand & community size.

= Can I search a list? =

Yes, you can search, filter & paginate within the matching items.

= Can I tell where my list is embedded? =

Yes, Listly tracks how many views each list sees on each domain where it's embedded (& where people voted).

Click on the total view count & that will open a lightbox & display all the view metrics broken down by domain.

You can click on URL in that list & take you to the blog post URL. 

= Can I turn off voting & letting people add to my list? =

Yes, its a pro feature.

= Can I see who's voted? = 

Yes, click on the total number of votes. And then you can see who's liked & disliked any given item.

You can click on the person's avatar & follow them to their profile.

= Do I have to use the plugin? = 

No, there's a javascript option. We'd recommend the plugin for performance reasons & for SEO reasons. The plugin caches lists locally, offering a second level of caching beyond the caching offered on Listly. Also the Listly list does not appear to the search engines as a widget, but as text so your list content is fully indexed.

= Are changes reflected on my embeded blog post? = 

Yes, the list is first loaded from cache (on your Wordpress install or on Listly). Once the list is loaded it calls to Listly to check for changes & then those changes are shown on your blog.

== Screenshots ==

1. Apply your publisher key & click save in order to enable the Listly plugin
