Plugin to easily integrate responsive List.ly lists / listicles in posts & pages on Wordpress & beyond.

== Description ==

Plugin to easily integrate List.ly lists on Wordpress. Add/edit lists, add items to lists and embed lists as responsive content using customizable shortcodes. 

Listly lets you curate and crowdsource any list embedded in a blog post / page. 

Listly empowers your audience to contribute to the list content on your blog. People can also embed other people's lists on their blog.

Use Listly to create useful resource lists (eg Top 10 Wordpress plugins) or Listicle type list (eg 10 Tricks Every Wordpress Developer Wish They Knew). Listly is also great for creating playlists of videos, slides, audio & images. 

30% of blog posts on the web are in the form of lists, Listly just makes those posts social and collaborative.

Here's a video to explain the value of embedding Listly lists on your Wordpress blog:

Think of Listly as Slideshare for lists. Put your lists on Listly them embed them on your blog. Listly is an responsive authoring platform for lists that can be seamlessly embedded in blog posts across the web. 

Here's 5 simple ideas to begin using Listly on your Wordpress blog.

1. Track your [guest posts](http://list.ly/list/DNy-guest-blog-posts-2014) on other blogs for easy resharing
2. Create people lists of [your team](http://list.ly/list/Bt2-sp24-speakers-and-team?feature=search) for a given blog or project.
3. Create universal [playlists](http://list.ly/list/1Jt-sampler-official-listly-whitelisted-media-playlist) of relevant slides, videos and podcasts to embed on your blog
4. Create lists of [related posts or resources](http://list.ly/list/8KM-content-marketing-tools) to help your readers 
5. Manage your [blog roll via Listly](http://polleydan.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/listly-blogroll/) so anyone can  / vote, re-use and extend your list.

We think of Lists as a type of data, just like you think of Slides, Videos or Podcasts. All these technologies have evolved in similar ways to be highly embeddable. They have also become highly trafficed search destination sites. See graphic on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/nickkellet/embeddable-media-categories-shareable-content-v3)
