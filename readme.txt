Brings the power of the Listly platform to engage your audience with list posts in gallery, slideshow, magazine, and list layouts.

== Description ==

[Listly](http://list.ly) exists because the human species is drawn to numbered lists.  Fact: List posts get viewed and shared more than other content. Analytics drive publishers to create 30% of content as numbered list posts. Listly makes it easy to create, maintain, and engage your readers with compelling list posts (also known as listicles in pop culture) right inside your WordPress site.
